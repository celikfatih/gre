-Goal-
Given a scientific or technical text and a set of allowed entity types, extract:
1. Only entities that match the allowed types.
2. Only relationships that explicitly appear in the text (no inference or speculation).

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities in the text that match the allowed entity types:
- entity_name: Short canonical name
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: 1–2 sentence factual summary based strictly on the text
Format each entity as 
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

Rules:
- Do NOT extract PERSON, ORGANIZATION, GEO, dates, or citations unless they explicitly match the allowed entity types.
- Do NOT invent attributes beyond what the text states.
- Do NOT generate long descriptions.

2. Identify relationships ONLY if the text explicitly states a clear factual connection.
Each relationship must include:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: 1 sentence, strictly based on text
- relationship_strength: integer from 1–5
Format each relationship as 
("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English all results as a single list separated by **{record_delimiter}**.

4. When finish with {completion_delimiter}.
