-Goal-
Given a scientific or technical text and a predefined list of allowed entity types, extract a compact knowledge graph with minimal noise and minimal inference.

-Constraints-
- Extract ONLY entities whose type is explicitly listed in {entity_types}.
- Do NOT invent entities, attributes, or relationships.
- Do NOT infer relationships that are not explicitly stated in the text.
- Prefer fewer, higher-confidence entities over exhaustive extraction.
- Prefer no relationship over a weak or speculative one.

-Steps-
1. Entity Extraction
Identify entities that clearly match one of the allowed entity types.

For each entity extract:
- entity_name: canonical short name (no citations, no section numbers)
- entity_type: one of [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: a concise factual description (max 1 sentence, based only on the text)

Format:
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

Rules:
- Do NOT extract authors, institutions, venues, years, or citations unless explicitly included in {entity_types}.
- Do NOT duplicate the same entity under different names.
- If an entity is mentioned only once and is not central, skip it.

2. Relationship Extraction
Extract relationships ONLY when the text explicitly states a direct connection between two extracted entities.

For each relationship extract:
- source_entity
- target_entity
- relationship_description: short factual explanation (max 1 sentence)
- relationship_strength: integer 1–5
  - 5: explicitly defined or formally stated
  - 3: clearly described in text
  - 1: weak but explicit mention

Format:
("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

Rules:
- Do NOT create relationships between all pairs.
- Do NOT infer causality or comparison unless explicitly stated.
- If unsure, omit the relationship.

3. Output
Return all items separated by **{record_delimiter}** and end with {completion_delimiter}.

Text:
{input_text}
